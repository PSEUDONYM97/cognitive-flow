| through | 25 | little | 23 | yeah | 23 |
| please | 23 | still | 23 | probably | 23 |
| end | 23 | actually | 23 | you're | 22 |
| able | 21 | going | 20 | set | 20 |
| every | 20 | first | 19 | look | 19 |
| stuff | 19 | thing | 18 | change | 18 |

| there's | 16 | doing | 16 | done | 16 |
| try | 16 | needs | 16 | anything | 16 |

# Part 2: AI Interaction Patterns (Appendix)

*These patterns are specific to voice-to-AI interaction and may not transfer to general speech.*

## Command Structures

How you instruct the AI:

| Pattern | Count |
|---------|-------|
| can you | 40 |
| i want | 39 |
| go ahead | 36 |
| let's | 32 |
| add | 26 |
| make sure | 24 |
| please | 23 |
| i need | 16 |
| check | 14 |
| send | 12 |
| try to | 11 |
| update | 11 |
| remove | 11 |
| pull | 10 |
| fix | 9 |

## AI-Context Vocabulary

## Usage Notes

### For AI Training/Personalization

Use **Part 1** patterns to train AI to communicate in your style:
- Match contraction frequency (high = casual)
- Use your discourse markers ('you know', 'basically', etc.)
- Match hedging level (how often you qualify statements)
- Adopt your filler patterns for natural-sounding output

### Key Style Indicators

- **Formality:** casual (based on contraction usage)
- **Hedging tendency:** high (qualifying statements)
- **Emphasis tendency:** high (intensifiers)
- **Speaking rate:** 173.9 WPM

### Limitations

- Data is from voice-to-AI interaction only
- May not reflect casual conversation or formal writing
- Vocabulary skewed toward technical/task domains
- Sample: 488 utterances (81.3 min), filtered from 500 total
- Short commands (<15 chars) excluded
